      "I use one of the most popular development framework tools. I've been using React, since my beginnings, more than 4 years ago. React allows me to build websites from scratch. Sites that contain the minimum necessary: translations, interactivity and made to last in time. Also, as is well known in our field: MERN, it has forced me to learn and master React Native to reuse source code from my React projects and export them to Android and IOS effectively.",
